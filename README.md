 Jewel Game!
-------------
The goal of the game is to match your number with the number generated in the box at the top of the page.

 How it works
--------------
At the beginning a random number is generated and placed in the box at the top of the page.

A randomly generated value is created and stored for each of the jewel buttons.

When you click a jewel it adds the assigned value to the players total. 

If you match the value of the user number to that of the computer button you win!

If the players number goes over the value of the computer number you lose!

Upon winning or losing the game automatically resets with a new computer number, as well as new values for each of the jewel buttons.

Good Luck!
